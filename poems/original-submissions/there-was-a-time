There Was A Time

There was a time when life hit you hard
And the other day you cherished it to the fullest

There was a time when you presumed that angels are real
And the other day you felt that sometimes monsters win

There was a time when you were angry, ill mannered, raged
And the other day your heart melted by new born's contact

There was a time you ran after power
And the other day you felt reassurance in your mother's lap

There was a time you felt demons inside you
And the other day you were envoy of God

There was a time you did things intentionally
so that one can feel extactly what you have felt
And the other day you forgave them

There was a time when you were concerned about others
And the other day you choose yourself over others

There was a time when you cried it loud
And the other day you killed the pain inside

There was a time when your friends turned into your foes
And the other day you hug the strangers

There was a time when you gave up
And the other day you wore an armour and fought like a knight

Sometimes you ask Sometimes you give
Sometimes you loose sometimes you win
There was a time and there will be
Just hold the breath and dive into it..!!!
