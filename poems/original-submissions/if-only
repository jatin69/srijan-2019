If Only

If there would be an ocean, 
I'd have crossed it.
But there were eyes, in which I drowned.

If there would be a sky,
I could have touched it,
But there was a soul, I could only sense.

If there would be a mountain, 
I could have conquered it,
But there was a person, I want to live. 

If there would have words, 
I could have said them. 
But there were emotions, I could only feel. 

Life is short, good moments are few, 
But I can only see you as, 
A pretty beautiful flower and a drop of dew.
