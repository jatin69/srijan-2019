### Artificial Intelligence.

If you're in touch with the real world, you must have heard of this term. And if you do know, you must be fascinated by it. After all, the words say it all - intelligence that isn't natural, one that has been constructed.

A simple google search will come up with hundreds of articles, images, books, media, movies devoted to it. Nowadays, we see robots thinking, code pouring down a screen and if you're lucky you might as well find " The Terminator " buried somewhere in there.

But is this how we define AI? An omnipotent robot? Or is it just something Hollywood fancies us to buy?

Perhaps, it is easier to connect to an audience via these clich√©s. But do we need them today? In the age of Alexa, Cortana, face detection in mobile phones and Google Maps, do we really require a false depiction of AI?

Let's understand this in a simple way. We solve problems using our natural intelligence. AI is a machine's ability of analysing and solving problems by "simulating" functions of the human brain.

### Some myths about AI

Now that we have a formal definition of what it is, let's counter some myths that plague this field.

**1. AI == Robots**

No. AI is any machine that has the property of exhibiting intelligence, performing tasks that are an essence of human intelligence.
Sure, a robot does employ concepts of AI, but the keyword is "employ". A machine that can recognize images is AI, perhaps limited in its scope but nevertheless AI.

**2. AI == Machine Learning**

Machine Learning(ML) is a subset of AI. Machine Learning is only a means of achieving AI; a faster, smarter, efficient way. If we had to create a program that recognizes trees from a photo, we could possibly write it in code. How long would it take? Well, long enough to cause a headache. So, instead of writing complex rules and specifications to achieve a goal, we make use of ML. Machine learning is "training" an algorithm so that it learns the objective. Training involves feeding it a huge amount of data so that it adjusts, improves and eventually learns.

**3. AI can work with any variety of data**

Certainly, but when your face recognition system says you look like a car, it doesn't take long to dawn upon you that something went amiss. Any AI system needs high-quality information that pertains to the problem at hand; data with some noise (unstructured, meaningless data) is fine but that noise can't be a heavy-metal song, pun intended. AI is a program and a program obviously needs good data.

**4. AI will rule over the world**

If we go by any conventional science-fiction movie on the matter of AI, yes. In real life, no. Ever since "AI" transcended from academic knowledge to general circulation, it has been fashioned and manipulated. Likening the power of an AI-powered machine to that of a human in power is imaginative but essentially, bizarre.

Today's AI is a snail against what it actually can be. A machine that has intellectual capacity will operate for us. It won't destroy but rather enrich our lives. Semantics cannot be created from syntactic logic. Machines will always require human input and intervention. And the said machines will be smart enough to assess the significance of its creator - us. Maybe there is a threat, but that kind of revolution hasn't happened yet. Besides, if we are capable of recognizing an intimidation that is unreachable today, we are more than proficient of treating it. The hype created by pop culture shouldn't be a hindrance in research, inventiveness and innovation. AI is already a part of our lives. It's time we ask questions that help us comprehend it - what it is, what it is not, what it can be and what impact it will have on our lives.
