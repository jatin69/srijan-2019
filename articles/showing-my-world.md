Remember these commands from the elementary class “programming” language that you learned in your school? It was always a moment of delight to be able to use LOGO for developing programs. A feeling of superiority filled you in with every output. But, that was a decade ago.If we look back and compare it to what students are learning today, being amazed would be an understatement. 

The younger generation of today has platforms like - CodeHS. A web-based teaching curriculum developed by two Stanfordian Jeremy and Zach which offers
various courses based on Python, JavaScript and even Augmented Reality(AR).

Those days are not far when a 9-year-old kid will have to study about or get familiarised with topics such as  machine learning,artificial intelligence and data mining to say the least. Prepping for the future, here are two terms that can be explained to children using simplistic examples. 

### 1. Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence :

If you were a pokemon fan, you definitely remember the pokemon detection device used by Pikachu's trainer Ashley. He used to click a picture and the device would instantaneously recognize a Pikachu and its layout details. That very device is the best example of machine learning.

How do you recognize a person? By remembering their features. Names, complexion, color of eyes, height etc.The next time you see them, you are able to recognize them immediately from this past knowledge. Machine Learning is the same concept. This time however, the machines are trying to remember and recognize things. Exactly what our pokemon detection device folowed.
The Machine remembers the yellow color, two ears, black stripes, big oval black eyes and the red dots on the cheek, promptly recognizing a pikachu when it sees one. Not only a pikachu, it can remember and recognize all kinds of pokemon by learning on their features.

### 2. Blockchain Technology :

Chit Games were always the best part of the recess, recalling the scores of the previous day - the worst. However, there was always this one sweet,  person in every group who would keep track of all the scores in the back of their notebook. And one another person who would never agree with the kept record. They would accuse the others of cheating.

Soultion? Some of us would also start keeping track of the scores. But then, on some occasion the gang leader would demand changing the score because it was their best friend’s birthday. All of us have faced this unfair scenario. Haven’t we ? Result- everybody had to waste the last page of their notebook in keeping track of the scores so that no change  would go undetected.

Extending this to adulthood, imagine if someone manages to alter data that's crucial, like bank balance. To safeguard agains this, blockchain technology uses the same concept as above. Everyone has a copy of all the transactions. Therefore, no one can is able to hack and alter the balance of any one person. It cannot be reflected back to so many people.


We've just managed to show how one can involve a 9-year-old into the said "complex" world of computer science. No concepts are hard to follow. Learning can always be made fun and inclusive. To conclude, it's when we can explain composite ideas in easy, intuitive ways, have we actually learnt them.
