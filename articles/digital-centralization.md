Gone are the days when life without Internet was actually possible for all of us. There was a time when we used to question the credibility of the Internet. But today one canâ€™t even imagine his/her life without a 5.5-inch rectangular case which we call a smartphone and probably, they should not. Wherever we go, we found ourselves to be surrounded by a vast number of gadgets. From a smartphone with a digital assistant to a smart TV with digital streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime, smart devices have taken over almost every aspect of our lives.

Now the question that has been arising in the minds of tech giants in recent years: What now? The answer is a newly born term: Digital Centralization. It is a way of developing a smarter living by a feature of connecting all the devices so that everything works in sync, enabling you to have access to all the functionalities even when you have few devices available.

Imagine yourself going out somewhere visiting an old friend. On the way, a thought continuously haunts you that whether you have switched off the lights or locked all the doors and windows of your house or not. But you fear not, for the power to control your destiny lies in your hands. You pull out your smartphone, open your smart lock app and check the status of your door only to find that your worst fear has come true. But still, you are calm and composed for you remotely lock your doors and go back to your day as usual.

Have you ever wondered what if our walls were able to differentiate between a human's touch and appliances? Fascinating, isn't it? In the foreseeable future, thinking about the plastic switches on our walls that control different appliances will fill us with nostalgia. "Smart" walls are in the early stages of conception. These startling walls have a lot of potential. They will be able to monitor activity in a room, adjust the temperature and even provide alerts when an appliance is turned off. Surprisingly, it can also track people wearing electronic devices by detecting their EM signature.

Well, this is not all. Digital Centralization can also be used to complement our business activities. We are glued to our smartphones, tablets or laptops for our business pursuits, even when we work from homes. This capability will further provide us the ability to host virtual meetings and do virtually everything that can be done in the office without any interruption. 
Data Centralization also aids in coordination. Individuals who are authorized will have access to the information seamlessly, without it being duplicated. This results in happier customers, and an increase in revenue. For a smooth-running data center, less chaotic work and more time to achieve other goals, all organizations should consider Data Centralization.

If all this is achieved, technology will indeed be a game-changer in almost every sector.
