An enormous unexplored part of Deep web is the illicit Dark Web. The World Wide Web is made up of Surface Web, Deep Web and Dark Web.

The Surface Web, commonly known as Visible Web, is that portion of the web that is readily available to the general public and is searchable with the web search engines. Suprisingly, less than 5% of the web falls under this category. That is through our web search engines we can only access 5% of the World Wide Web.
The Deep Web or Invisible Web is part of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search engines. These contents are hidden behind HTTP forms. This includes web mail, online banking and other services that users must pay for and hence protected using payment gateway. Thus, for accessing beyond the public web page using direct URL, it requires additional authentications.
Lastly, the Dark Web, also referred to as the darknet, is an encrypted portion of the internet that is not indexed by search engines. These consists of web resources or web pages that exists on overlay networks that require specific software or authorization to access just like how we need a torch to see in the dark.
Dark Web is often portrayed as a platform of enigmatic and criminal activities because of its anonymity. The websites in Dark Web have a special URL which is tailed up with onion extension. [websitename].onion (e.g. torprojectqyqhjn.onion) domains are not indexed by regular search engines, and hence you can only access Dark Web with special software.
Popularly known as “Evil Twin” of Internet!
The Dark Web is believed to generate $500,000 in transactions daily. Users can purchase fake passports for as little as $1,000.00. Bitcoin lottery tickets, fake coupons, and even fake degrees can all be had for the right price. Dark Web constitutes a small subset of Deep Web and is made up of all different kinds of website that sell drugs, weapons and even hire assassins.
How to reach Dark Web?
Reaching dark web is just like peeling an onion...
Onion routing is an anonymous networking technique. In an onion network, the messages are binded in various layers of encryption, similar to layers of an onion. Onion Routing prevents the transport medium from knowing who is communicating with whom -- the network knows only that communication is taking place.
Each system connected to Onion network identifies itself as a node. Messages are constantly encrypted and then sent through several such network nodes called Onion Routers which creates a circuit of nodes. Messages are put in cells and unwrapped at each node or onion router with a symmetric key. Each onion router removes a layer of encryption with its symmetric key to reveal routing instructions, and sends the message to the next router where this process is repeated.

ZeroDayLab’s partner Intelliagg released  a white paper on the Dark Web, where over a sample period, they monitored over 30,000 top level sites or .onion (Hidden Services).
Key findings from the research include:
•	46% of the 30,000 hidden services analysed were active at the time of the assessment(the other 54% of sites could be attributed to C2 servers or other temporary uses such as onion shares, ricochet chat).
•	76% of the sites were in English, unsurprisingly Chinese and German as second and third languages.

•	48% of the sites were classified as illegal.

•	With manual classification of over 1,000 sites, it was deemed that 68% of the content was illegal according to US and UK law.

•	File sharing (29%), leaked data (28%), and financial fraud (12%), were the top classification of hidden marketplaces. Surprisingly, hacking only made up 3% of the sites interrogated.

•	Interestingly, 39% of sites interrogated were unlinked, meaning they were extremely difficult to find.
