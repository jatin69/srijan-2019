Yes, you heard it right. In the foreseeable future, thinking about the plastic switches on our walls that control different appliances will fill us with nostalgia. "Smart" walls are in the early stages of conception. 

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research have already devised ways of infusing intelligence into walls to some degree. At a cost of $20 per metre, with a few coatings of conductive paint and some electronics, they have managed to transform plain and simple walls into smart ones. These walls can differentiate between a human's touch and appliances.

Chris Harrison, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) says that although walls are usually the structure with the largest surface area in a room, they are not used much. Other than to separate spaces, hold up pictures and attach shelves, walls are not used in their capacity. He further adds - as IoT and pervasive computing develop, the idea that walls could become an active part of our living is intrigue in itself.

## Walls++
Dubbed as Wall++, the researches use the following procedure: Using painter’s tape, they create a cross-hatched pattern on a wall to create a grid of diamonds. Tests have confirmed for this being the most competent electrode pattern. Afterwards, an application of two coats of conductive paint is applied. The tape is then removed and electrodes are connected. Finally,  a top coat of standard latex paint is used to finish the entire process, a consequence of which is an increase in durability and concealment of the electrodes.

Two modes — capacitive sensing and electromagnetic(EM) sensing can be used to operate these walls. In the first mode, the walls function like any other capacitive touch sensor. When a person touches the wall, its electrostatic field gets distorted at that point. In EM sensing mode, in order to identify objects and their locations, the electrodes differentiate between their particular electromagnetic signatures.

This system has lots of potential. It can monitor activity in a room, adjust the temperature and even provide alerts when an appliance is turned off. It can also track people wearing electronic devices by detecting their EM signature.

## Yet to achieve
As intimidating as this seems, there is still a long way to go. Wall++ is still to be revamped for energy consumption, says Yang Zhang, a PhD student at HCII. Though the general functionality seems to be sound, an alternative to installing sensor boards on each wall is required. If achieved, the technology will be a game-changer in almost every sector.

To conclude, the future seems bright for Wall++. Walls might literally have ears and a voice, and we will be able to ask them the million dollar question - Who is Alexa?
