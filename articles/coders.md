A programmer has plenty of things that keeps them up all night. Their top concern is no longer to develop an algorithm that keeps them with the pace but, “the fear of being replaced”, being replaced by AI. They fear that their development efforts would be replaced by robots. But is it?
Is there a point in becoming developer now since artificial intelligence might take up that job? Is Artificial Intelligence going to take up their places in the IT industry? Is it reality or just a hype?

While the technology is still in its early childhood, it represents a major advancement in using artificial intelligence (AI) for developing software, and can potentially make programming much less time intensive for human developers. AI nowadays is doing things which were once performed by humans. The most common example is the chatbots, which assist users just like customer executives used to do. Other examples include facial recognition at the passport gates, planning logistics and even creating art.

So, it’s somewhat true that AI will take up our jobs and this is just the beginning. For instance, jobs that involve CSS and HTML have already started disappearing because of the services like SquareSpace that allows you to build and design a static website without any bit of coding. You can design your website the way you want it to be, without even the need for any web-developer. Surprisingly, this isn’t even AI. It’s just a well-designed software. However, AI tools are also available for building a full website from just a mock-up image.

The technical jobs like creating dynamic websites, creating codes, data science are safe for now but AI would continue to spread more and more. The reality is that AI won’t take their jobs, it would rather be a helping aid to developers. AI would be an incredibly powerful tool for creating better products. It will help programmers to do their job better. Developers would be liberated and would be able to think about software more strategically.

In the next 100 years, there is no doubt that a lot of existing jobs would become obsolete. Just from a description of features, AI would be able to create incredibly complex software. If AI can become capable enough to figure out stuff that is wanted and then do it, you would not need any unique software packages anymore.

Technology might make the current jobs obsolete but it will open new job opportunities. 100 years ago, no one would have thought that web-designers, JavaScript developers, data science developers, or mobile developers would be a job in the future. Similarly, in the next 100 years there are going to be various new jobs that we can’t even imagine.
You could be an alien designer - designing synthetic life forms to make distant planets habitable for humans — or a warp-drive operator or UFO driver. Who knows!

So, it’s worth becoming a developer but since this industry keeps progressing, you would have to keep yourself updated. Learn new technologies timely. Grow your skills continually. Adopt AI to make your life easier, wink.
