Hello! Take your eyes off this magazine and look around for a moment. What do you observe? You will see people using their phones, laptops or other electronic gadgets, with their eyes fixated on their screens. The world is at our fingertips. Everything is accessible by a couple of taps on our gadgets. But, despite the advantages that these devices offer, the time expended on them results in major side effects.

Content provided by social media and entertainment apps/sites is virtually indefinite, consumption of which is making us procrastinators and addicted. From binge-watching our favorite shows to working on a project, most of our time is spent sitting before a screen. This is the precise definition of "Screen addiction". It is becoming predominant with each passing moment; with the internet being easily and economically available to all. We have already reached a point where we have acknowledged its normalcy and blissfully ignored the humongous problem it is becoming.

Nowadays, we do not even try to remember things that are trivial. All we need to do is whip up our phones or laptops and do a quick search to get all the answers we need, or probably reach out to people using messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp to figure out minor inconveniences. As convenient as this sounds, we end up becoming lazier with every search query.

## The trouble is real.

In a recent report from Taiwan, a woman who made extreme use of her phone on maximum brightness was found to have 500 holes in her cornea.

Furthermore, in Australia, in a recent survey conducted by Huawei, it was found that running out of battery is a subject of strain for people.

## How do we control this menace?

On an individual level, self-control is first and foremost in controlling screen addiction or any addiction whatsoever. To stop the urge to touch gadgets, turn off all the useless notification alerts, use the do not disturb mode, and set some ground rules for phone usage. Replace the time spent on using phones with some other activity, such as reading.

App makers and operating system developers are also taking measures to counter this problem. For instance, Google has been providing statistical data on app usage to users so that they can track their usage and observe their behavior. YouTube has added a feature which enables the users to see how much time they spend using the app. Also, the latest version of Android will be launching an app called "Digital Wellbeing", which will remind users to take breaks from the screen. For older versions of Android and IOS, there are third-party apps available which can be used to prevent phone addiction.

## Restraint is the key.

Modern technology has provided us with a wide range of gadgets that have opened a seamless world of information and entertainment. However, their misuse and overuse are leading to various health and psychological problems. It is, therefore, up to us to use technology in ways that benefit us.
