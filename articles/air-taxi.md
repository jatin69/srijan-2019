Recently, Uber has selected India among 5 global locations outside USA for launching UBER ELEVATE. Yes, this seems to be a dream but its reality. UBER has made a good step choosing India because of its growing population and congestion on roads in metro cities. As a starting step, Uber Air will start its test flights in Dallas-Fort and Los Angeles in 2020 with commercial flights proposed to be starting in 2023. India, Japan, Australia, France and Brazil are the nominated countries for the third, international, destination for Uber Air flights. “For these air taxis, cities with high population, where traffic congestion is to the extent that travelling a distance of 10-15 kilometers will take an hour, are the ideal one“. In India, New Delhi and Bangalore are the most suitable cities for these urban taxis. 

## WHAT AIR CRAFT UBER AIR WILL USE ?
Helicopters are costly and noisy. Uber is planning to use eVTOL aircraft. eVTOL aircrafts are special kind of aircrafts having the following features that makes Uber to choose them : 
1.	eVTOL aircrafts runs on battery, thus making them environment friendly.
2.	eVTOL can take off and land vertically, So not needing a runway.
3.	eVTOL can fly huge distance, once fully charged.

## What would be the pricing ?
For a regular commute, prices might be prohibitive in beginning. But due to the comfort and high facilities provided by Uber, number of commuter can still be in very large absolute number. In cities like New Delhi, Uber can surely generate a large revenue by these air taxis.

### WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES ?
Since, this is the first ever concept Uber is launching in India, there are many challenges at the moment. Some challenges are :
1.	Type of aircraft is still to be finalized (though eVTOL seems to be the final one), it could be a winged model, or something that works like a drone. 
2.	Battery is another challenge, battery should sustain a charge for at least 100-km flight. 
3.	Sky port locations where the aircraft will take off, land, can be charged and maintained. Central locations in cities are the preeminent ones as commuters are likely to travel through those locations more likely, thus, it will have a huge cost implication.

### Will it really help cut congestion ?
The main aim of air taxis is to convert transportation from surface to sky. The new concept is the mobility via air. It is a new node based facility where each node is connected to other nodes in the same city. For example, travelling from Gurugram to Connaught Place will just take 10 min, thus saving at least two hours every day for a regular commuter. We can just hope that by 2023 we will be flying away to our relative’s houses via a quick and hassle free ride instead of taking a six hour drive on the highway.

To conclude, India is growing in technology with time. If successful, 2023 will see a new regime of urban transport where reaching from source to destination will take negligible time without any hustle of traffic jams. The major challenge for India now is to make this proposed transporting system a success.
