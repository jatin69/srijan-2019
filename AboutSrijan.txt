Srijan means creation.
Srijan is the annual magazine of Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi. It is launched every year at Sankalan.

Srijan started with an aim to capture the tremendous advancements in technology and lay out a bigger picture in a few words.
Since then, we have been trying to capture and highlight what happened in the past year and what lies ahead.
Srijan aims at giving a complete roundup of the emerging tech within the field of computer science.

Magazine also includes some ART, as we believe programming is an ART. And one who can program is an Artist at heart.

This year, Srijan is kept open to all technologies around the world.
Due to the advancement of technologies in different tech fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
Networks and many more, we have included 
all the current advancements in computer science around the world.
Department of Computer Science takes immense pleasure to announce volume 9 of Srijan successfully, 
with all new enthusiasm and zeal towards a new era of computer science.
Along with Tech articles, Srijan'19 includes some poems, written by the students at DUCS and some glimpses of annual activities for freshers at DUCS, 
such as Skit, Freshers, Diwali Night, Sankalan etc.
