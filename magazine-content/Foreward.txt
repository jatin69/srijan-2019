The Editorial team of DUCS is delighted to present the ninth edition of the Annual Tech Magazine - 'SRIJAN'. 

All around us, Innovation keeps transcending expectations every day. There are no frontiers to its scope. There's always room for enhancement, 
refinement, update. To scale beyond what we have achieved so far. To develop new methods of analysis. To solve problems that seem unattainable. 

Keeping the ever-expanding sphere of technology in mind, we've tried to keep the content - boundless, imaginative and inquisitive.

The reader has a choice from an extensive list of sections. From the latest hot topics - GANs, Air taxis, Artificially conscious machines to the topics 
that require a level-headed discussion - Fake news, Automated quandary, the magazine tries to capture all aspects of the modern world of technology.

Get ready to dive into a blended world of curiosity, ideas and insight. We hope you like it.
