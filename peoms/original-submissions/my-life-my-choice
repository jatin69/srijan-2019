My Life, My Choice..

Life is a roller coaster ride of ups and downs,
You can choose either to be a king or a clown.
The path to your dreams might be full of thrones,
Have courage and live your life the way you want.
A time may come when you're broken or shattered,
When you just have lost your precious battle.
That shall be the time to prove the strength in you,
Don't worry, the potential to face it all is within you.
Neither good nor bad times, for long, shall stay,
So take charge of your life before it's too late.
Arise, awake, act and stop not till you reached the goal,
Else the regret shall later overpower your soul.
You can do anything and everything only if you believe,
Think, work and success will be what you'll achieve.
Not immediately but definitely you'll get it one day,
Have faith, be patient and you'll see success coming your way.
Dreams come true by wanting them from the bottom of your heart,
And giving them everything that you've got.
For thoughts have the power to become reality,
A beautiful reality that is in your hand and not of the almighty.
Everything happening around has a reason behind it,
Just live it, love it, feel it and learn from it.
Break free the chains and live life to the fullest,
Take risk without regrets and give everything your best.
Life, itself, is the greatest blessing,
That God has given us to enjoy everything.
We must be grateful for the experience that come our way,
And to the people who help us to live our life everyday.
